  <p class="lead">We are working toward an open source, decentralized server for storing humanitarian activities and serving Humanitarian Activity Streams.  The open API will allow authenticated third party applications to consume and/or create humanitarian acitivites streams.   Follow an organization or individual and receive realtime updates.  The data is decentralized on an organization's or individual's server.  It's open source so relief organizations can run thier own servers and own thier data.</p>
