  <p class="lead">An open data standard and server with API will allow for the development of websites and mobile apps that improve coordination.  An example application might display the a Humanitarian Activity Stream for users responsing to a a specific disaster event with real-time updates pushed form the app via the HAX API.  Or maybe an organization has users log training and distribution when they happen, allowing for real time reporting back to donors</p>
